<h2 align=center>Jikes News</h2>

<h2 align=center>3 November 1999 <font size="-2"><a href="mailto:shields@watson.ibm.com">DS</a></font></h2>

<h3 align=center>Current version now 1.10</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix some problems in the new Unicode support (which were all the fault of Dave Shields, and not the author,
Vadim Zaliva).
<li>Rename option <code>+M=</code> to <code>+DR=</code>. <code>DR</code> stands for "Dependence Report". This is
to clear up confusion due to a poor choice of option name.
<li>Fix a problem that caused Jikes to exit with a return code of zero even though semantic errors had
been detected.
<li>Update <code>jikes.html</code> to reflect recent option changes, including a description of the 
<code>CSO</code>option.
Update the "What is Jikes" section to include some introductory material written by 
<a href="mailto:lgrinzo@stny.lrun.com">Lou Grinzo</a> for an article in developerWorks: 
<a href="http://www-4.ibm.com/software/developer/library/jikes.html">Speeding up Java Development</a>. We
thank Lou for granting us permission to use this material.
</ul>

<h2 align=center>27 October 1999 <font size="-2"><a href="mailto:shields@watson.ibm.com">DS</a></font></h2>

<p>I've just posted a new snapshot with some recent changes from
Philippe to make Jikes more closely follow Sun's format for
converting floating-point to string. Though an improvement, this code does not yet implement the full
algorithm, as outlined by Steele, et.al., in POPL 1990.

<h2 align=center>25 October 1999 <font size="-2"><a href="mailto:shields@watson.ibm.com">DS</a></font></h2>

<h3 align=center>Mandrake includes Jikes and JikesPG</h3>
<p>Jikes and JikesPG are now included in <a href="http://www.linux-mandrake.com">Mandrake Linux</a>. We don't
know when they were added.

<h2 align=center>23 October 1999 <font size="-2"><a href="mailto:shields@watson.ibm.com">DS</a></font></h2>
Mike Ernst and I were able to sort out the problems compiling his latest changes on Win/NT. The latest source 
passes the modena and jck tests, and the CVS snapshot has been updated.

<h2 align=center>19 October 1999 <font size="-2"><a href="mailto:shields@watson.ibm.com">DS</a></font></h2>

<h3>Current version now 1.09</h3>
<ul>
<li>Re-enable CSO code (that I wrongly deleted in 1.08)
</ul>

<h3>Latest CVS Snapshot now available</h3>

Pending resolution of problems with our open-source server, I will
post a new snapshot whenever I make a change to the current master
CVS tree at Research. I've added a new title line with links to the
snapshot and to the CVSWeb and read-only mirror maintained at
Sourcery.org.

<p>
Note that the CVSWeb mirror provided at this site is out-of-date. You need to use the one at Sourcery to view
the latest sources.

<h3>Some more info on CSO</h3>
There's an interesting note just posted in the <a href="tasks/cso/index.html">Tasks/CSO section</a>.
<h2 align=center>18 October 1999 <font size="-2"><a href="mailto:shields@watson.ibm.com">DS</a></font></h2>
<h3>Current version now 1.08</h3>
<ul>
<li>Re-enable incremental compilation.
<li>Fix several bugs, though we lost track of just what
was fixed. We'll try to update the bug database soon.
<li>Explicit divide by zero, which used to result in an error, now results in a caution. This
implements a suggestion of Neil Martin.
<li>Plug a memory leak.
<li>More code for Unicode enhancement from Vadim Zaliva.
<li>Some fixes for Mike Ernst's enhancements.
<li>A number of files have been renamed, in the <code>jikes</code> directory:
<ul>
<li><code>jikes.htm</code> is now <code>jikes.html</code>
<li><code>news.htm</code> is now <code>news.html</code>
<li><code>contrib.htm</code> is now <code>contrib.html</code>
</ul>
<li>The "old" news from the IBM Research site has been archived as <code>news_v1.html</code>
</ul>
<p>Since 1.08 is now out, the <code>pre108</code> pre-release has been withdrawn.

<h3>Thanks once more to Henner Zeller</h3>
<p>During a recent visit to the 
<a href="http://sourcery.org/jikes/cvsweb.cgi/">Jikes CVS Repository Mirror</a>
maintained by Ken Coar, I noted mention of help he had received from Henner Zeller. Henner has
made several contributions to the project, including writing the RPM <code>spec</code> file that was a
great help packaging Jikes for Red Hat 6.1 (I only had to make some changes in the internal documentation).
I mentioned this in a note to Ken, who wrote back:
<pre>
Yar, I'm putting Henner's cvsweb script in on the mirror in
place of the original I snarfed from Apache.  Henner has no
doubt seen lots of updates being made to the script; he was
kind enough to give me commit access to the repository
whence it lives.

Ken Coar

<h3>Open-source server status</h3>
Our open-source server is not yet fully up. We have been told everything should be in place by the end of this week.
In the interim, we will continue to use the Research mail-lists and CVS tree (the one shadowed at Sourcery.org). We
will continue to publish news and files for downloading here. Thanks for your patience.

<h2 align=center>13 October 1999 <font size="-2"><a href="mailto:shields@watson.ibm.com">DS</a></font></h2>
<h3>Current version now 1.07</h3>
The current version is now 1.07. This version includes improved support for debugging (<code>-g</code>) and also adds some 
work-in-progress code for CSO (classpath search order) and enhanced Unicode support.

<h3>pre108: 1.08 Pre-release</h3>

We have started work on 1.08, and have just published the first 
<a href="pre108/index.html">1.08 pre-release</a>. We are now
distributing three versions: stable, current, and "pre", where "pre"
is mainly for use of the Core Team and interested parties as we try
to continue work while our friends at developerWorks work to bring up
our new server.

<h2 align=center>13 October 1999 <font size="-2"><a href="mailto:shields@watson.ibm.com">DS</a></font></h2>

<p>All the recent patches received from Philippe, Vadim and Joe
Berkovitz are now in the <a href="107pre/index.html">1.07
pre-release</a>. The new option <code>+CSO</code> can be used to
select Joe's suggested <code>classpath</code> search order.

<p>The latest version passes the modena and jck11 tests.

<p>We hope to make this the "current" version soon. However, Philippe
has recently added a unified block stack; this is the sort of change
 than can cause very subtle errors. Though this version has
passed our test set, we are putting it out in "pre-release" form for
a couple of days, in the hopes we can weed out any show-stopping bugs
before wider distribution.

<p>So, if you are not faint of heart, and are willing to help us out, take the 107 pre-release for a 
spin.

<h3>Neil Martin joins Core Team</h3>
The Jikes Project Core Team is pleased to announce that Neil Martin
has accepted our invitation to join the Core Team.

<h2 align=center>11 October 1999 <font size="-2"><a href="mailto:shields@watson.ibm.com">DS</a></font></h2>
<h3>Patch pc1009a</h3>
pc1011a, combined with pc1009a, passes jck and modena. We are testing merge of pc and vz patches now.

<h2 align=center>11 October 1999 <font size="-2"><a href="mailto:shields@watson.ibm.com">DS</a></font></h2>

<h3>Patch vz1011a</h3>
vz1011a, the latest Unicode patch set from Vadim, results in a version that
passes the standard tests, except for tests failed due to pc1009a.

<h2 align=center>10 October 1999 <font size="-2"><a href="mailto:shields@watson.ibm.com">DS</a></font></h2>
<h3>Patch vz1010a</h3>
vz1010a, the second Unicode-related patch set from Vadim has just been
installed. It mostly contains patches I forgot to include when installing vz1009a.

<h2 align=center>09 October 1999 <font size="-2"><a href="mailto:shields@watson.ibm.com">DS</a></font></h2>
<h3>Patch news</h3>
I have just included the latest work from Philippe and Vadim in both the Research and dw/OS CVS trees. I didn't include
all of Vadim's code, as I didn't have time to check fully for possible conflicts. There were two commits, which
I have tagged as follows:
<ul>
<li>pc1009a - Philippe's recent work on <code>LocalVariableTable</code> and the latest state of work on adding
a single unified block statck. This code compiles, but is known to fail some tests.
<li>vz1009a - some, but not all, of Vadim's recent work on extending Unicode support.
</ul>
I have created <a href="patches/index.html">Patches</a> directory to track this work. I will post the patches sent
in soon. For now I have put up two snapshots of the source:
<ul>
<li><code>jikes-pc1009a.tar.gz</code>: tarball with 1.06 + Philippe's changes.
<li><code>jikes-vz1009a.tar.gz</code>: tarball with 1.06 + Philippe's changes + part of Vadim's changes
</ul>


<h2 align=center>07 October 1999 <font size="-2"><a href="mailto:shields@watson.ibm.com">DS</a></font></h2>
<h3>Stable version now 1.06</h3>
The stable version is now 1.06.

<p>We hope to update the current version to 1.07 next week.

<h3>Red Hat 6.1 SRPM now available for download</h3>
<p>A friend at Tivoli kindly sent me a copy of the <code>SRPM</code>
Red Hat is shipping with 6.1. I have put a copy in the
<code>stable</code> directory.

<h3>Problems compiling Jikes using egcs</h3>
Vadim and <a href="mailto:cbj@gnu.org">Brian Jones</a> have reported
problems using latest <code>egcs 2.95.2</code> to compile Jikes 1.06.  Brian
writes:

<h2>Vadim to lead Unicode enhancement effort</h3>
Vadim is leading an effort to provide support for Unicode "code
pages". See <a href="tasks/unicode/index.html">Unicode task</a> for
further information.

<h2 align=center>03 October 1999 <font size="-2"><a href="mailto:shields@watson.ibm.com">DS</a></font></h2>

Just came across a good intro for CVS newbies: <a href="http://linuxtoday.com/story.php3?sn=10697">SunWorld: CVS in the Scripting
Landscape</a>. Article contains good section on resources with lots of links.

<h2 align=center>02 October 1999 <font size="-2"><a href="mailto:shields@watson.ibm.com">DS</a></font></h2>
<h3>We're open for business, sort of ...</h3>

We are waiting for Ken Coar to check out the Majordomo and CVS
installations before opening them up (he has been on vacation, but
recent e-mail indicates he is back and wading through the e-mail
backlog). I'm able to publish new web content, though I understand
others are having ftp, telnet problems. In any event, I'll try to
keep things up to date until everything in place. 

<h3>"Tasks" Section Opened</h3>

The <a href="tasks/index.html">Tasks Section</a> is now open for business.
<p>

In brief, a task is a short-term subproject that requires more than
e-mail to accomplish. A Core Team member can initiate a task at any
time, and a task begins with a home page in the Tasks Section. We
hope to soon be able to allow the easy initiation of new mail lists
for a task.

<p>Put another way, the Task Section is how Core Team members start
"scratching" an "itch". They start a home page, and then try to
attract an audience, or build a mini-community. At least that's the
idea. We'll see if it works out.

<h3>Task <a href="tasks/107pre/index.html">107pre</a>: V1.07 Pre-Release</h3>

<a href="tasks/107pre/index.html">107pre</a> is a new task to test the upcoming V1.07.
This will consist almost entirely of fixes to repair known problems
in the support of <code>-g</code> debugging option, which we think
were mostly caused by generation of incomplete/incorrect
<code>LocalVariableTable</code> entries.  This was all my fault -- I
did a crude first pass at this without appreciating what was needed.
Philippe has spent most of the last week on this one; even if there
are still some problems, based on past experience I'm confident the
necessary machinery is now in place, and remaining bugs should be
easily swatted.

<p>The posted binaries failed 2 of the JCK tests, and Philippe will
work on this over the weekend.

<p>It's hard to test this change, as one must either fire up a
debugger, or else dump class files and pore over the tables. We're
hoping someone will help us out on this one...

<h3>Task <a href="tasks/ieee754/index.html">IEEE754</a>: Jikes and IEEE-754 format arithmetic</h3>

<a href="tasks/ieee754/index.html">IEEE754</a> is new task for those with problems with Jikes
and IEEE-754 format arithmetic, and those who want to help out in this area. No answers yet, just an
initial note to get the ball rolling.

<h3>Task <a href="tasks/jcl/index.html">JCL</a>: Jikes Classfile Lister</h3>

<a href="tasks/jcl/index.html">JCL</a> is a new task intended to update our
classfile lister and make it part of the main distribution. Hacker(s)
wanted.


<h3>Vadim Zaliva now responsible for Unicode support</h3>

We have had a number of problem reports that Jikes should offer
improved support for Unicode. Jikes as it stands passes all the
Unicode-related tests, but it appears we should add additional
support for "code pages".

<p>
<a href="mailto:lord@crocodile.org">Vadim Zaliva</a> has assumed responsibility for Unicode-related issues.

<h2 align=center>27 September 1999 <font size="-2"><a href="mailto:shields@watson.ibm.com">DS</a></font></h2>
<h3>Jitterbug bug-tracking/reporting system now available</h3>

Our new bug-tracking system (Jitterbug) is now open for business. See 
<a href="http://jitterbug.samba.org/">Jitterbug site</a>
for instructions on use.  Please use 
<a href="http://www10.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jikes/bugs">Jikes Jitterbug</a>
to file new Jikes bug reports.

<p>
I'm not sure if Jitterbug can handle MIME-attachments (.zip, .tar.gz,
etc.). If it doesn't, please e-mail such files directly to me and I
will start a companion section in the Jikes Project pages to store
these files.

<p>
I will move over the outstanding (Open) Jikes Problem Reports from
the Jikes Discussion Database as time permits.

<h3>Jikes for RISC OS</h3>
<p>Just added to the <a href="ports.html">Ports</a> section:

<blockquote>
The initial port is now available from

This port still requires some work, but it does work :-)

<h3>Jikes to graduate from alphaWorks</h3>

Jikes will "graduate" from alphaWorks next Tuesday. The URL
(alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/jikes) will stay live, but will refer to our
new home. The discussion area will be kept, though no new postings
will be allowed.

<h3>Current and stable</h3>

Speaking of alphaworks, we used to say that alphaworks provided
"stable" Jikes, while Research provided "development" Jikes. Both
versions will now be distributed from this site, using "current" instead
of "development".


<h3>Jikes News now at developerWorks</h3>

The Jikes News file will now be published from our new home at
developerWorks.

<p>The previous edition of Jikes News, first published at our former site at IBM
Research, is still available, and may be of interest to readers unfamiliar with Jikes 
who wish to read about developments
from the release of the source for Jikes in December 1998 until our recent move to developerWorks:
<a href="http://ibm.com/research/jikes/news.htm">Research Jikes News (12/98-9/99)</a>

<h3>Glenn Kasten joins Jikes Project Core Team</h3>

The Jikes Project Core Team is pleased to announce that Glenn Kasten has
accepted our invitation to join the team.

<h3>Relocation Progress Report</h3>

I have copied over most of the content from the Research site: contrib, index, news and ports.
Downloads for current and stable versions should be available, as well as new 'pub' subdirectory with master source
 in <code>tar.gz</code> format.

<h3>The Jikes Masthead</h3>

Finally, after waiting since December, I am able to display my
daughter Jennifer's "handshake" Jikes Masthead.
Oh happy day!
Oh happy dad!

My thanks to Dave Whitinger and Dwight Johnson, co-founders of 
<a href="http://linuxtoday.com">LinuxToday</a> (my favorite Linux news
site) for running this masthead in the LinuxToday

banner pool -- for free -- since December. Dave recently reported it had
been shown over 1.1 million times, resulting in 4,000+ click-throughs
to our Research site.
