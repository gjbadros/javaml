	* xml-unparse.cpp (xml_name_string): convert < and & on a
	character-by-character basis to be more robust.
	(AstArrayInitializer) Use xml_unparse_maybe_var_ref so that
	elements in an array initializer are appropriately marked-up as
	variable references.  (AstCharacterLiteral) Use xml_name_string so 
	'<' gets output as '&lt;'.  (AstBinaryExpression) Handle
	instanceof expressions separately since they're second argument is 
	a type, not an %expr-elem;

	**** All changes to xml-unparse.cpp
	
	* Use &lt;=, not &le; for <=.  Duh.

	* Added FXMLStatementTagNeeded() and use it to try to eliminate
 	redundant <statement> tags more rationally.  Added
 	g_fTopLevelBlock to help in this regard.

	* Do not ignore all return statements that are at the end of a
	block -- only ignore them if at the end of a top-level block, and
	use g_fTopLevelBlock to track that state.

	* Added op attribute to assignment-expr to handle +=, /=, etc.

	* Eliminated some extraneous code.

	* xml-unparse.cpp: More changes -- avoid nested <statements> more
	reliably.  Clean up a bunch of #if 0 code, #ifdef XML_LONG_WINDED
	code.  Use "interface" attribute on "implement" tag (not
	"class").  Use &lt; and &amp; in xml_name_string, instead of
	trying to use higher-level operator names that won't convert back
	properly to plain text.

	* README-JAVAML: Added.

	* java-ml.dtd: Added. The document type definition (DTD) for
 	JavaML; useful with SGML-aware editors (e.g., psgml mode for
 	Emacs) and for validating parsers (e.g., JADE:
 	http://www.jclark.com/jade)

 	* xml-unparse.cpp: Added to unparse into JavaML representation.
  	See http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/gjb/papers/javaml/javaml.html

	* Makefile.in: Added xml-unparse.o to list of files, and added its 
	build rule.

	* ast.h: Updated all AST node classes to have XMLUnparse() method
	(analogous to existing Unparse() method)

	* control.cpp: Added handing of debug_xml_unparse_ast option

	* jikes.cpp: Updated usage message to include usage for +ux, +udx, 
	the new XML unparsing options.

	* option.cpp, option.h: Handle the +ux, +udx options
