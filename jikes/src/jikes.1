.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBJikes\fP translates Java(TM) source files to bytecode. Features
include strict adherence to the language specification, automatic
makefile generation and incremental compilation.

.SH OPTIONS
\fBJikes\fP may be invoked with the following command-line options:
.TP
\fB\-classpath\fP path
use path for CLASSPATH
.TP
\fB\-d\fP directory
write class files in specified directory
.TP
\fB\-debug
no effect (recognized for compatibility)
.TP
\fB\-depend
recompile all used classes
.TP
\fB\-deprecation
report uses of deprecated features
.TP
\fB\-g
debug (generate LocalVariableTable attribute)
.TP
\fB\-nowarn
do not issue warning messages
.TP
\fB\-nowrite
do not write any class files
.TP
\fB\-O
do not write LineNumberTable
.TP
\fB\-verbose
list files read and written
.TP
\fB\-Xstdout
write error messages to standard output, not stderr
.TP
\fB\+1.0
recognize only 1.0.2 language
.TP
\fB\+\+
compile in incremental mode
.TP
\fB\+B
do not invoke bytecode generator
.TP
\fB\+D
report errors immediately in emacs-form without buffering
.TP
\fB\+E
list errors in emacs-form
.TP
\fB\+F
do full dependence check except for Zip and Jar files
.TP
\fB\+K\fPname\=TypeKeyWord
map name to type keyword
.TP
\fB\+M
generate makefile dependencies
.TP
\fB\+M\fP\=filename
write report of dependencies to specified file
.TP
\fB\+P
Pedantic compilation - issues lots of warnings
.TP
\fB\+T\fPnn
set value of tab to nn spaces
.TP
\fB\+U
do full dependence check including Zip and Jar files
.TP
\fB\+Z
treat cautions as errors
.PP
An argument may have the form \fI@file\fP; each line of \fIfile\fP is
then interpreted as an argument, except that lines beginning with
\fI@\fP are not expanded recursively. 

.SH FILES
\fBJikes\fP requires a colon-separated list of directories or files
that tell it where to look for any needed class or source files, for
example ".:/java/lib/classes.zip".  A definition given with the
environment variable \fIJIKESPATH\fP takes precedence over one given
with \fICLASSPATH\fP; a definition using the \fI-classpath\fP option
takes precedence over any value specified via the environment.
