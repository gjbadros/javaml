This directory contains the source for the IBM Research Jikes
Compiler, licensed under IBM Public License Version 1.0 - Jikes
Compiler, contained in the file ../license.htm.

If you are building Jikes on a Unix-based system, then try

	./configure; make

The file ./configure was generated by the autoconf program using the
files ./configure.in and ./Makefile.in as inputs. If you have problems
with above and also have a copy of autoconf on your system, then you can
try

	autoconf; ./configure; make

If you are building Jikes on system not based on Unix, the file
./Makefile.hand contains a makefile with a number of clauses at the start
giving the options needed for several systems.  All the clauses have
been commented out. You need to uncomment the clause for your system
before using this file, or create a clause using the ones available as
a guide.

Complete program source is enclosed. However, note that some of the
files are machine-generated. Any changes that require edits to the
file ./java.g will also require you to obtain a copy of the Jikes
Parser Generator (jikespg) from http://ibm.com/research/jikes. See the
section on compiling Jikes in the file ../jikes.htm for more
information.

You can also obtain set of test programs (jikestst) from
http://ibm.com/research/jikes.

If you have further questions, you can consult the archives of the
Jikes mailing lists, or subscribe to the Jikes list and then seek
help. See http://ibm.com/research/jikes/subscribe for information on
subscribing to the mailing lists.
