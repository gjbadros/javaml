It *looks* nice, but several mistakes have been introduced in the proof
that were not in my final submission.  Please have these corrections
made and forward me another proof so we can work together to be sure
that the paper is of the highest quality.

Thanks,
Greg


Page 4, right column, 2nd line:
The XSL comment has been mangled into
  <!- email DTD ->
instead of:
  <!-- email DTD -->
    ^^           ^^
The two consecutive hyphens at both the start and the end are necesarry
for the example to be correct.

Page 4, right column, 4th line:
The text:
  "encoding ..."
is not indented, and it needs to be.  The double-quote should be
indented as far as the "e" and "%" of the last two lines of that 12
line example (i.e., under the "T" of "ENTITY" as it currently is, but
all of the indentations could be reduced to three spaces if needed).

Page 10, right column, about 1/3 down:
  % sggrep '.*/literal-string' }
The last character is a typo and needs to be a backslash instead:
  % sggrep '.*/literal-string' \

Page 10, right column, about 1/2 down:
All of the literal-string lines that wrapped the "value=" to another
line need to have that second line indented 3 or 4 spaces.  (There are
three such lines.)

Page 11, left column, about 1/2 down:
All of the var-ref lines that wrapped the "idref=" to another line need
to have that "idref=" line up with the "name=" from the preceding line
so that the "i" is under the "n".   (There are three such lines.)

Page 11, right column, about 1/2 down:
The line:
  % sggrep -q 
needs a "\" (backslash) added to the end (because the remainder of the
line got wrapped to the next line.  That remainder of the line should
get indented so that the "'" (apostrophe) is as close to possible as
being under the "-" of "-q".

Page 11, right column, about 4/5 down:
  the two consecutive apostrophes on the third line of the

  % sgrpg '.*/method' \
          '.*/send[message=drawLine]' \
          '' '%s %s
          ^^ these apostrophes

are way to close and they look like a double-quote, not two consecutive
' characters.

Page 12, left column, about 4/5 down:
The XSL comment has again been mangled into:
  <!- mostly do an identity transform ->
instead of:
  <!-- mostly do an identity transform -->
    ^^                                 ^^

The two consecutive hyphens at both the start and the end are necesarry
for the example to be correct.


Page 12, left column, bottom 1/3 of column:

The whole example is missing the indentation that my final submission
had-- the indentation is extremely helpful to understanding the
example.  Please see my final submission to correct this.


Page 14, figure 4, just over 1/2 down the figure:

  return parseXMLFragment($doc,<<"__END_FRAGMENT__"

should be indented so that the "r" in "return" is under the "#" above it.

Also, the two consecutive "<"s (less-thans) in the above "return..."
line have been turned into an open French quotation marks -- they must
be separate "<" characters.


Page 19, vitae:

The image of my face does not get rendered properly by Acroread-- I see
the image appear, but then the mask outline is drawn on top with the
supposed-to-show-through part drawn in opaque white instead of being
transparent.  (This may be a bug in Acroread, but please confirm that it 
prints properly on the device you're doing final typesetting with.)
