Possible Analyses:
* check that only abstract classes have abstract methods
* check that all functions have only one return statement
* changing sense of a default parameter (via overriding, since no defaults in Java)
* renaming a method
* search for unused variables


XML DTD Stuff:

If an attribute is specified to be entry, then when the tag
is used it should be <foo>, not <foo/>
