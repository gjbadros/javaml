I read through it (somewhat quickly) and will leave a marked-up copy for
you tomorrow.  Looks good!  In particular the design choices made in this
paper seem like good ones.  I can see why you're in a hurry to get this
published - if you don't do it someone will very soon.

If you want to include another example, a diff one would be good - you
could describe the advantages of doing a JavaML diff over a text one.

I didn't like the POSR acronym at all.  I'd just use the phrase "text
represention" in its place.

I'd leave out the sentence about "possibility of user-defined syntactic
extensions" - this ignores the rise and collapse of the extensible language
movement in the 70's.
