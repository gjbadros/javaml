Hey, Greg,


Hope your trip was a good one.

Here are a few high-level comments on your paper:

- I'd slightly lessen the magnitude of some of your claims against POSR
stuff; it sounds like hyperbole to te talking about "disastrous" semantic
changes, infamous examples, etc.

- In your XML overview, you should mention that most elements have an
open/close syntax, but that empty tags also exist (you use these later, but
never introduce them)

- In Section 3.2, I'd mention why you give IDs new names, rather than just
using the name attribute (the reason is obvious upon thought, but it's
better to state it outright)

- Is there a particular reason you used literal-string, literal-number with
a "kind" attribute, etc.?  (It's not as uniform as I'd expect.)  I'd suggest
you take a quick look at XML Schema and use the same sort of definitions as
they do, for purposes of standardization.  I think that there's a decent
possibility you'd like to query a document for all literals and literal
values without having to say "literal-string | literal-number"...

- I wouldn't use "continuation" as the attribute name for a second
declaration at the same line - it has a language-related meaning that has
nothing to do with this, and that could be confusing.

- Do you think that it's best to write a research paper in first-person
singular, even if you're the only author?

- Beware, the output of sggrep *isn't* a valid or well-formed XML document.
You need one set of open and close tags around everything for this to be
true.

- I think that showing one or two XSLT/XQL queries would be a really good
idea, if you've got time to add them.  These are where the action is at;
SGML is passe...  Syntax for Xpath and XQL is actually pretty close to what
sggrep uses, so this shouldn't be too hard.

For working implementations, I think I can hunt them down for you.
Actually, IE5 has a decent implementation of a preliminary version of XSLT,
and can do some of the stuff you'd want.

- You can find lots of tools to reference from OASIS or IBM's alphaWorks.

In general, the paper looks pretty good.  I think the main thing is to tie
it in a bit more with the hot XML stuff, and you should be just about set.

I'll try to get you more detailed comments tomorrow, when I can actually
look at the paper *on paper* instead of via IE.  Let me know if you have any
questions or want help chasing down various things.  Good luck!


Zack
