<BR>You will be receiving a series of mail messages from the conference organizing committee in the coming days.  The important things for you to do next are:
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>1. Read the comments of the reviewers carefully and, where appropriate, make the requested changes to the content of your papers.
<BR>
<BR>2. You will receive instructions from Elsevier Science Publishers on changes that MUST be made to put your article in a form suitable for paper, on-line and CD-ROM submissions.  Please follow these instructions carefully.
<BR>
<BR>3. Register for the conference before April 10th to get the early registration discount.  Visit http://www9.org/w9-newreg.html for registration details.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>On behalf of the WWW-9 program committee, I would like to congratulate you on having your paper accepted.  We all look forward to seeing you in Amsterdam in May!

</DD> <P> <DT>Comments for author</DT> <DD>This is an excellent paper and I feel strongly that it should be accepted. I have only three suggested revisions for the author.
<BR>
<BR>First, your paper is one of the longest papers I reviewed for this conference, mainly due to the appendices. In revising the final submission, I would look for ways in which the paper can be reduced (perhaps by reducing the intro to java and intro to XML sections.)
<BR>
<BR>Second, in section 2.1, you argue why Java is "ideal" for being represented in XML. This causes the reader to wonder if the approach can be applied to other languages who may not share these "ideal" features. I think you address this concern in bits and pieces throughout the rest of the paper, but I think you should collate those comments and put the reader's concerns to rest early in the paper.
<BR>
<BR>Finally, in the related work section, you may want to comment on other  efforts to produce a language-independent representation of programming languages. For instance, work at the Univ. of Mass., Amherst produced a representation called IRIS that could represent both Ada and (I believe) C programs in a unified representation. While they used a binary representation and a set of tools on top of that representation to access it, the approach is similar to what you are doing and should be referenced and compared. I believe Lori Clarke was the PI on this work.</DD></DL><P><DL><DT><STRONG>Report 2 for paper 342</STRONG></DT> <DD>Relevance:  Yes <BR>

</DD> <P> <DT>Comments for author</DT> <DD>[This is a rewrite of comments lost in a crash; they are undoubtedly less coherent than the originals.]
<BR>
<BR>The paper is a mixed bag.  On the one hand, your section 4 makes very nice use of the JavaML representation.  On the other hand, there are significant failings in the JavaML DTD and you fail to consider some important related work.  In this case, the failings outweigh the strengths.
<BR>
<BR>The primary failing is that the JavaML DTD is clearly incorrect.  It is also confusingly designed and ill-documented.  Here are some representative problems:
<BR>* Java's two uses of extends (for classes and for interfaces) are handled in two very different ways (as an attribute for classes and as nested children for interfaces).  [Design issue.]
<BR>* Although the Java Language Specification (section 6.4.3) specifies that "The members of an interface type (section 9.2) are *fields* and methods", the JavaML DTD only allows interfaces to have fields. [Significant Error.]
<BR>* The JavaML DTD allows interfaces to have any protection, while the Java Language Spec clearly disallows private and protected interfaces. 
<BR>[Minor Error.]
<BR>* There seems to be no support for anonymous inner classes.
<BR>
<BR>There a host of areas in which the JavaML allows incorrect structures. It seems that most of these decisions were to allow a superset of the language in exchange for simplicity.  Some more careful explanation of these decisions is warrented.  (The use of "field" for both "class field" and "instance field" is another such example; that decision may have led to the difficulties with interfaces mentioned above.)
<BR>
<BR>In general, a more careful discussion of the DTD and the design desicions made would strengthen the paper.
<BR>
<BR>There does not seem to be much careful consideration of language issues that cannot be handled by the syntax tree, such as the scoping of variables.  It is likely that you felt those would introduce too much complexity, but some consideration in the narrative would have been useful, particularly as you compared yourself to other techniques for analyzing programs, such as syntax-directed editors (see below).
<BR>
<BR>I was surprised to see so little comparison to other work on markup languages for programming languages and to structure editing (another technique for analyzing programs).  For example, some reference to Knuth's work on "literate programming" would have been useful, since it is likely that JavaML could be used for more than program analysis.  Similarly, some comparison to Reps' work on syntax-directed editing with attribute grammars would be helpful.  For example, it may be that you can elegantly specify some of the things that an attribute grammar checks using sggrep and other programs, but it also may not be difficult to check such things.  (How might you say "rename all uses of Foo's bar method to baz"?)
<BR>
<BR>Some other issues:
<BR>
<BR>Your section 2.2. is awkward.  If the reader knows XML, it's not necessary.  If the reader does not know XML, the example is not very helpful, since it does not include many things you use in the JavaML DTD, such as entities, repetition (*), 
<BR>
<BR>It would have been interesting to see this tested on a more interesting set of code than the Cassowardy Constraint Solving Toolkit which seems relatively small (under 10,000 lines) and which, from the example given in Appendix 2a, does not use very many features.  It certainly would have been nice if the example in the appendix had taken advantage of inheritance or "implements".
<BR>
<BR>It's not clear why the "isBall to FIsBall" example is any better using JavaML than it would have been using Perl and straight program code.  For example, something like "s/(\W)isBall\(/$1FIsBall\(/g" should accoplish the same thing.
<BR>
<BR>Some minor quibbles:
<BR>* In the abstract "numerous ... analysis" should be "numerous ... analyses".
<BR>* The "extra semicolon" example in the C code is not particularly illuminating, as there are a host of ways to detect that error.  (It might also have been interesting to come back to that example in your section 4.)
<BR>* It's not clear why you need nested "&lt;statements&gt;" tags in your exmaples (e.g., in section 3.2)
<BR>* The "list all sends of clones" example seems to be lacking an open-arguments tag.  Is that a failing of sggrep, JavaML, or ...
<BR>* The "isBall" to "FIsBall" example uses "bar" and "Bar" in the code.
<BR>* Your citation format is quite odd.  Typically, one uses authors or their initials for citation.  Alternately, you could number the sources.  It seems like you've stuck with a private shorthand.
<BR>* Modern citation styles also dictate that you give a date accessed and date last modified for online sources, such as Web pages.</DD></DL></DL>
